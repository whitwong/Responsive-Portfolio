      <p>Hello! My name is Whitney Wong. I grew up in Plano, TX and graduated from The University of Texas at Austin. I completed my degree in Biomedical Engineering in 2013 and currently work at a pharmaceutical manufacturing facility as a process engineer. Even though I don't have a background in programming or design, I was drawn to web development and all the opportunities it provides. I started learning HTML and CSS on my own. After a few months, I decided that I needed to take it a step further and applied to enroll in The Coding Bootcamp at UT and was accepted! Now I'm attending classes and am motivated more than ever to broaden my knowledge and skills so that I can become a full-stack web developer.</p>
      <p>Outside of work and classes, my main interests are snowboarding, wakeboarding, and hiking. My experience so far with coding is similar to when I started learning to board. It can be painful and very frustrating at times, but once I started grasping the concept it became addicting.</p>
      <p>It's a pleasure to introduce myself, and I hope I have the opportunity to hear from you! To reach me, select the Contact link at the top of the page or connect with me on GitHub, LinkedIn, or Stack Overflow.</p>
